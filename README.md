# Server Log Viewer

As an administrator, having to go through and read log files can be quite a pain. Especially when you log looks like this...

Now, you can simplify that process.

[IMAGE]

Each line is separated into an appropriate tab.
The server tab shows things like Plugin output and misc server output.

[IMAGE]

Each person is assigned a color, so each time they say something they have a unique color.

[IMAGE]

Commands can also be colorized.

[IMAGE]

Command Block output also has it's own tab.

[IMAGE]

The Access tab shows the join and leave messages.

[IMAGE]

The Restricted Access shows the banned and not white-listed messages.

[IMAGE]

The player list shows everyone who logged in on that log, and their uuid.

[IMAGE]

There is also an extra panel for taking notes, or anything.

You can Search through the log as well as open multiple logs at one time.

You can also set your own set of tabs, and set your own rules to determine what goes into those tabs.

In addition to that, you can also choose which tab have player lists, and which rules will colorize by player names.

Live log viewing is as simple as clicking the Server Menu and clicking Launch.

This will also unzip compressed log archives.
